This repository is built with Coq 8.7.1.

It requires `LibTatics.v` from [TLC](http://www.chargueraud.org/softs/tlc/) and
[metalib](https://github.com/plclub/metalib). The former is included in the
directory. The latter can be installed via Github.

This work checks with Coq's native theory -- it includes no Axioms or other
extensions.
